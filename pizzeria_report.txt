1. Write down your brief thoughts on how you approached this problem.
Answer:
The simplest way is to traverse through the NxN matrix vertically, horizontally and diagonal and increase the
initial value by 1.
So I created a class 'Block', which has a function build_block, that first builds a 2D array to show the range
of pizzeria and sets the value to 1 if the range is within and 0 if it falls outside the range. After which
there is a for loop to traverse through the NxN matrix vertically, horizontally and diagonal. The function then
flips the block created upside down in other to match the (0,0) bottom left corner indexing stated in the question
as the results generated by th function generates a (0,0) top left corner indexing.


3. What is the complexity of your solution? Can it be improved?
Answer:
The time complexity of the algorithm used in the solution is O(n)^2 and can be improved by using the divide and
conquer algorithm which has a time complexity of O(n)^1.58.
